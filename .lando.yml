# The best way to improve performance is to exclude WP directories from bind mounting.
# This means that you will NOT be able to make changes to these files at runtime,
# they will be copied to the internal docker instance on startup and not synced.
# You'll have to restart lando in order to copy changes.
# Remember to rebuild after making changes to the lando.yml.

# Additionally, if you are using composer, you'll want to add the vendor/ directory -- or node_modules for node.
